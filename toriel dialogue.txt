* This way.			Tędy.
* Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.		Witaj w twoim nowym domu, dziecie.
* Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of the
  RUINS.			Pozwol mi nauczyć cie poruszać się w RUINACH
* The RUINS are full of
  puzzles.			RUINY sa pelne lamigowek.
* Ancient fusions between 
  diversions and doorkeys.	Starozytny system dywersji i kluczy
* One must solve them
  to move from room to
  room.				Jeden musi rozwiazac je aby przemieszczać się miedzy pomieszczeniami
* Please adjust yourself
  to the sight of them.		Proszę sie im przypatrzyć.
* To make progress here, 	
  you will need to trigger
  several switches.		Aby progresować, będziesz musialx uruchomić wiele dzwigni.
* Do not worry, I have 
  labelled the ones that
  you need to flip.		Nie obawiaj sie, zetykietowalam te, które musisz uruchomić.
* ... eh?			... eh?
* It seems that the
  labelling has worn away.	Wyglada na to ze etykiety sie starły.
* Oh dear.			Ojejku.
* This might be far more
  challenging than I
  anticipated...		To może być znacznie trudniejsze niż zakladalam...
* The first switch is over
  on the wall.			Pierwsza dzwignia jest tam na scianie.
* Do you need some help..?	Potrzebujesz pomocy?
* Press the switch on the wall.	Uruchom dzwignie na scianie.
* Come on, you can do it!	Dawaj, dasz rade!
* Go on, press the switch
  on the left.			No już, przelacz dzwignie po lewej.
* I believe it was		
  the switch on the
  left.				Wydaje mi sie ze to miała być dzwigna po lewej.
* You do know which way
  left is, do you not?		Wiesz w która strone jest lewo, prawda?
* Press the switch that I
  labelled for you.		Przelacz dzwignie która ci otykietowalam.
* You are very curious, 
  are you not?			Jestes bardzo ciekawski, czyz nie?
* Please understand. 	
 I only want the best
  for you.			Proszę zrozum, ja tylko chce tego co dla ciebie najlepsze.
* Splendid! 			Wysmienicie!
* I am proud of you, 
  little one.			Jestem dumna z ciemie, malutki
* Let us move to the
  next room.			Chodzmy do następnego pomieszczenia
* As a human living in
  the UNDERGROUND, 
  monsters may attack you.	Jako człowiek zyjacy w PODZIEMIACH, potwory mogą cie atakować.
* You will need to be
  prepared for this
  situation.			Będziesz musialx być przygotowanym do takiej sytuacji.
* However, worry not! 		Jednakze, nie martw sie!
* The process is simple.	Postepowanie jest proste.
* When you encounter a 
  monster, you will enter
  a FIGHT.			Kiedy napotkasz potwora, wstąpisz w WALKE/
* While you are in a
  FIGHT, strike up a
  friendly conversation.	Podczas WALKI, rzuc przyjazna konwersacje.
* Stall for time.
  I will come to resolve
  the conflict.			Poczekaj. Przyjde rozwiazac ten problem.
* Practice talking to
  the dummy.			Pocwicz rozmowe z atrapa.
* Ahh, the dummies are
  not for fighting! 		Ahh, atrapy nie sluza do walki!
* They are for talking!		One sa do rozmawiania!
* We do not want to hurt
  anybody, do we...?  		Nie chcemy nikogo skrzywdzić, prawda..?
* Come now.			Chodz teraz.
* Ah, very good! 		Ah, bardzo dobrze!
* You are very good.		Jestes bardzo dobrx.
* ...				...
* ... you ran away...		... ucieklxs...
* Truthfully, that was
  not a poor choice.		Szczerze, to nie była zla dezycja.
* It is better to
  avoid conflict
  whenever possible.		Lepiej ominąć konflikt, kiedy to możliwe.
* That... however, is
  only a dummy.			To... jednak, jest tylko atrapa.
* It cannot harm you.		Nie może cie skrzywdzić.
* It is made of cotton.
* It has no desire
  for revenge...		Jest stworzone z bawełny, nie pragnie zemsty...
* Nevermind.			Niewazne.
* Stay close to me and	
  I will keep you safe.		Trzymaj sie blisko mnie a będziesz bezpiecznx.
* ...
* ...
* The next room awaits.		Nastepny pokoj czeka.
* Practice talking to
  the dummy.			Pocwicz konwersacje z atrapa.
* You can say anything... 	Możesz powiedzieć co chcesz...
* I do not think the dummy
  will be bothered.		Nie sadze, ze ta atrapa bedzie urazona.
* Do you need some
  ideas for conversation
  topics?			Czy potrzebujesz jakies pomysły na rozmowe?
* Well, I often start with
  a simple 'how do you
  do...'			Coz, ja często zaczynam z prostym 'jak sie masz...'
* You could ask them about
  their favorite books...	Możesz spytac sie ich o ulubione książki...
* Jokes can be useful for
  'breaking the ice.'		Zarty mogą sie przydac w 'lamaniu lodu'
* Listen to this one...		Posluchaj tego...
* What did the skeleton
  tile his roof with?		Co mowi ogrodnik do ogrodnika?
* ... SHIN-gles!		... Przesadziles!
* Well, I thought it
  was amusing.			Coz, osobiście uważam to za fascynujące.
* The dummy will not
  be bothered.			Atrapa nie zostanie urazona.
* There is another puzzle
  in this room...		Kolejna lamigowka znajduje sie w tym pomieszczeniu...
* I wonder if you can
  solve it?			Ciekawi mnie, czy dasz rade ja rozwiazac?
* This is the puzzle,
  but...			To jest ta lamigowka, ale...
* Here, take my hand
  for a moment.			Potrzymaj mnie za reke.
* Puzzles seem a little
  too dangerous for
  now.				Lamigowki wydaja sie zbyt niebezpieczne na razie.
...
* Greetings, my child.		Witaj, me dziecko.
* Do not worry, I did
  not leave you.		Nie obawiaj sie, nie opuscilam cie.
* I was merely behind this
  pillar the whole time.	Bylam za tym pilarem caly czas.
* Thank you for trusting
  me.				Dziekuje za twoje zaufanie.
* However, there was an
  important reason for
  this exercise.
* ... to test your
  independence.
* I must attend to some
  business, and you must
  stay alone for a while.
* Please remain here.
* It's dangerous to
  explore by yourself.
* I have an idea.
* I will give you a
  CELL PHONE.
* If you have a need for
  anything, just call.
* Be good, alright?
* You have done
  excellently thus
  far, my child.
* However... I have a
  difficult request to ask
  of you.
* ...
* I would like you to walk
  to the end of the room
  by yourself.
* Forgive me for this.
* Hello there,
  little one!
* The pie has not
  cooled down yet.
* Sweet dreams.
* You'd rather stay
  up and chat with
  me, then?
* Up already, I see?
* Um, I want you to know
  how glad I am to
  have someone here.
* There are so many
  old books I want
  to share.
* I want to show you
  my favorite bug-
  hunting spot.
* I've also prepared
  a curriculum for
  your education.
* This may come as
  a surprise to you...
* But I have always
  wanted to be a
  teacher.
* ... actually, perhaps
  that isn't very
  surprising.
* STILL.
* I am glad to have
  you living here.
* Oh, did you
  want something?
* Well, talk to me
  again if you
  need anything.
* What?
* This... this IS your
  home now.
* Um... would you like
  to hear about this
  book I am reading?
* Oh, hello!
* Did you want to
  hear about the
  book I am reading?
* It is called
  "72 Uses for Snails."
* Here is an exciting
  snail fact.
* Um...
* How about an exciting
  snail fact?
* Did you know
  that snails...
* Have a chainsaw-like
  tongue called a
  radula?
* Sometimes flip their
  digestive systems
  as they mature?
* Make terrible
  shoelaces?
* Talk. Really. Slowly?
* Just kidding, snails
  don't talk.
* Well, bother me
  if you need anything
  else.
* ... I have to do
  something.
* Stay here.
* If you need anything,
  just ask.
* ... I have to do
  something.
* Stay here..
What a terrible
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent youth...
Ah, do not be
afraid, my child.
I am TORIEL,
caretaker of
the RUINS.
I pass through this
place every day to
see if anyone has
fallen down.
You are the first
human to come here
in a long time.
I will do my best
to ensure your
protection during
your time here.
Come!
I will guide you
through the
catacombs.
* Oh, may I enter
  the trash as well?
* On second thought,
  do not put me
  in the trash.
* Oh my...
* Yes, it is beautiful,
  is it not?
* But we should really
  think about what comes
  next.
* Frisk...
* You came from this
  world, right...?
* So you must have
  a place to return to,
  do you not?
* What will you do
  now?
* Welcome to your new
  home, innocent one.
* Allow me to educate you
  in the operation of
  the RUINS.
I think you should
think of your own
name, my child.
   
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 .....
 ...?
 What are
 you
 doing?
 Attack
 or run
 away!
 What are
 you
 proving
 this way?
 Fight me
 or
 leave!
 Stop it.
 Stop
 looking
 at me
 that way.
 Go away!
 ...
 ...
 ...
I know you want
to go home, but...
But please... go
upstairs now.
I promise I will
take good care
of you here.
I know we do not
have much, but...
We can have a
good life here.
Why are you
making this so
difficult?
Please, go upstairs.
.....
Ha ha...
Pathetic, is it not?
I cannot save even
a single child.
No, I understand.
You would just be
unhappy trapped
down here.
The RUINS are very
small once you
get used to them.
It would not be
right for you to
grow up in a
place like this.
My expectations...
My loneliness...
My fear...
For you, my child...
I will put them aside.
Urgh...
You are stronger
than I thought...
Listen to me,
 small one...
If you go beyond
this door,
Keep walking as
far as you can.
Eventually you will
reach an exit.
...
....
ASGORE...
Do not let ASGORE 
take your soul.
His plan
cannot be allowed
to succeed.
......
Be good,
won't you?
My child.      
Y... you...
really hate me
that much?
Now I see who I
was protecting by
keeping you here.
Not you...
But them!
Ha... ha... 
You...
... at my most
vulnerable
moment...
To think I was
worried you
wouldn't fit
in out there...
Eheheheh!!!
You really are
no different than
them!
This is
for your
own
good.
No one
will
leave
again.
Your fate is up to
you now!
Eh??
You are ending
it NOW?
And on such a
dramatic moment...?
But there WILL be
more, will there
not?
Well.
What is the point
of that now?
Hmmm.
Perhaps I will
bake another pie.
That last one ended
up a little burnt.
You are just going
to eat it all...
Snoring on the
floor is NOT help.
It's over.
* No no no!
* You want to press the
  other switch.
* I even labelled it for
  you...
* It seems that is not
  the correct switch.
* Do not worry about
  me.
* Someone has to take
  care of these flowers.
* Hello...
* Are you all right?
* You must be so lost
  and confused...
* Ah, do not be
  afraid, my child.
* I am TORIEL,
  caretaker of the
  RUINS.
* I pass through here
  every day to see if
  anyone has fallen down.
* You are the first
  human to come here
  in a long time.
* I will do my best
  to protect you during
  your time here.
* Come!
* I shall guide you
  through the catacombs.
* How did you get
  here, my child?
* Are you hurt?
* Not a scratch...
* Impressive!
* But still...
* There, there, I will
  heal you.
* Who did this to you? 
* You will get an apology.
* I should not have
  left you alone
  for so long.
* It was irresponsible
  to try to surprise
  you like this.
* Err...
* Well, I suppose I
  cannot hide it
  any longer.
* Come, small one!
* Oh dear, that took
  longer than I
  thought it would.
* Do you smell that?
* Surprise!
* It is a butterscotch-
  cinnamon pie.
* I thought we might
  celebrate your
  arrival.
* I want you to have
  a nice time living
  here.
* So I will hold off
  on snail pie for
  tonight.
* Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
* Er, I assume that
  expression means you
  do.
* S... surprise!
* I have baked a snail
  pie.
* So I...
* Here, I have another
  surprise for you.
* This is it...
* Is something burning...?
* Um, make yourself
  at home!
* A room of your own.
* I hope you like it!
* I think you should
  play upstairs
  instead.
* It is dangerous
  to play here.
* It is drafty here.
* You will catch
  a cold.
* It is dusty here.
* You will catch
  a cough.
* There is nothing
  to see here.
* Do you want to
  read a book?
* I do not like
  the game you
  are playing.
* Why not go for
  a walk in the
  yard?
* Really now.
* ...
* Hey, do not go down
  here.
* I have something
  to show you
  upstairs.
* You wish to know how
  to return "home,"
  do you not?
* Ahead of us lies the
  end of the RUINS.
* A one-way exit to the
  rest of the underground.
* I am going to destroy
  it.
* No one will ever
  be able to leave
  again.
* Now be a good child
  and go upstairs.
* Every human that falls
  down here meets
  the same fate.
* I have seen it
  again and again.
* They come.
* They leave.
* They die.
* You naive child...
* If you leave the
  RUINS...
* They...
* ASGORE...
* Will kill you.
* I am only protecting
  you, do you understand?
* ... go to your room.
* Do not try to stop me.
* This is your final
  warning.
* Goodbye, my child.
* That is right.
* Go upstairs.
* If you truly wish to
  leave the RUINS...
* I will not stop you.
* However, when you
  leave...
* Please do not come
  back.
* I hope you understand.
* You want to leave
  so badly?
* Hmph.
* You are just like
  the others.
* There is only one
  solution to this.
* Prove yourself...
* Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive.
* Prove to me you
  are strong enough
  to survive!
* ... wait.
* ... why are you looking
  at me like that?
* Like you have seen
  a ghost.
* Do you know something
  that I do not?
* No...
* That is impossible.
* Prove to me that you
  are...
* Hey, let me finish
* Already?
* What will it take
  for you to learn
  your lesson?
* It seems that everyone
  is quite eager to
  set off.
* Frisk...
* You really are a
  funny child.
* If you had said that
  earlier, none of this
  would have happened.
* It is a good thing
  you took so long to
  change your mind.
* Hee hee hee.
* Well...
* I suppose.
* If you really do
  not have any other
  place to go...
* I will do my best to
  take care of you, for
  as long as you need.
* All right?
* Now, come along.
* Everyone is waiting
  for us!
* Ah.
* ... I see.
* Well, I hope that
  I am not keeping
  you.
* "See you around."
  Frisk!
  This is all just
  a bad dream...!
  Please, wake up...!
* Oh!
* You are awake!
* Thank goodness!
* Errr...
* How about we give
  them space, first?
* They must be very
  exhausted.
* Though, from what,
  I am not certain.
* Frisk...
* We do not remember
  exactly what happened.
* There was a flower...
* And then, everything
  went white.
* But now the barrier
  is gone.
* When you are ready,
  we will all return
  to the surface.
* It seems the door to
  the east will lead
  us there now.
* But before then...
* Perhaps you might
  want to take a
  walk?
* You can say goodbye
  to all of your
  wonderful friends.
* Do as you wish.
* We will all wait
  for you here.
* Hello, Frisk.
* Alphys upgraded my
  phone.
* I am having a lot
  of fun with the
  "texting" feature.
* Sans, "check out" this
  one.
* Worry not, Papyrus.
* We are texting for
  a good reason.
* Sans, please do
  not say that.
* You are not a dork.
* You are more of
  a bonehead!
* Frisk, do not feel
  left out.
* I have been writing
  messages to you as
  well!
* You still have my
  phone number after
  all this time...
* Do you not?
* Frisk, how about
  you go look around
  before we all go?
* Seeing how many good
  friends you've made
  here...
* I am almost certain
  you must have made
  some more.
* Sans, did I tell you
  about the time Frisk
  flirted with me...?
* And then asked to
  call me "mother?"
* I felt so embarrassed
  for them.
* Oh, do I ever!
* But, I think that
  story is one of the
  most unbelievable.
* It is hard to think
  anyone would want to
  flirt with me.
* Well, it was not
  RIGHT after.
* It took a couple
  minutes.
* Oh, I should bake it
  for everyone sometime!
* Certainly!
* It would be fun to
  cook together!
* Hmmm... Flying sounds
  a little dangerous.
* Who the hell is Sans?
* Who the HECK is Sans?
What a miserable
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent, youth...
Do not be afraid,
my child.
It is I, TORIEL,
your friend and
guardian.
At first, I thought
I would let you
make your journey
alone...
But I could not
stop worrying about
you.
Your adventure must
have been so
treacherous.
... and ultimately,
it would burden you
with a horrible
choice.
To leave this place,
you would have to
take the life of
another person.
You would have to
defeat ASGORE.
However...
I realized...
I cannot allow that.
It is not right to
sacrifice someone
simply to let
someone leave here.
Is that not what
I have been trying to
prevent this
whole time?
So, for now, let
us suspend this
battle.
As terrible as
ASGORE is...
He deserves mercy,
too.
Do not "Tori" me,
Dreemurr!
You pathetic whelp.
If you really wanted
to free our kind...
You could have gone
through the barrier
after you got ONE
SOUL...
... taken six SOULs
from the humans, then
come back and freed
everyone peacefully.
But instead, you made
everyone live in
despair...
Because you would
rather wait here,
meekly hoping another
human never comes.
(Sigh.)
NO,
Asgore.
Hello.
I am
TORIEL.
Are you
the
human's
friend?
It is
nice to
meet
you.
Oh!
Are you
another
friend?
I am
TORIEL.
Hello!
Hello!
That
voice
...!!
Hello,
I think
we
may...
Know
each
other?
I am
TORIEL.
So nice
to meet
you.
Oh!
Wait,
then...!
This must be your
brother, Papyrus!
Greetings, Papyrus!
It is so nice to
finally meet you!
Your brother has
told me so much
about you.
Hey, Papyrus...
What does a skeleton
tile his roof
with?
No, silly!
A skeleton tiles
his roof with...
SHIN-gles!!!
W-wait!
Not in
front of
the
human!
Hee hee hee.
My child, it seems
as if you must
stay here
for a while.
But looking at
all the great
friends you have
made...
I think...
I think you will
be happy here.
Do not be afraid,
my child...
No matter what
happens...
We will always
be there to
protect you!
