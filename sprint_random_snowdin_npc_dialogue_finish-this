* Can we PLEASE play something&  else...?/%%
* Hmmm..^1.&* When humans play Monsters&  and Humans.../
* Do they just call it&  Humans and Humans?/%%
* Let's play Monsters and Humans!/%%
* Let's continue to play&  Monsters and Humans!/%%
* Now we can play Monsters&  and Humans with REAL humans!/%%
* Everyone is always laughing&  and cracking jokes^1, trying&  to forget our modern crises.../
* Dreariness^1.&* Crowding^1.&* Lack of sunlight./
* I would join them^1, but I'm&  just not very funny./%%
* At least I'm not making puns./%%
* Wait^1!&* I've got a joke!/
* Knock knock!/
* ... Uh^1.&* That's all I've thought of./%%
* Looks like I don't have&  to worry about cracking&  jokes anymore./
* I was going to say a joke&  here^1, but I really don't&  have one./%%
* It just feels like..^1.&* Like everything is getting&  worse and worse./%%
* I "put out a line" for some&  girls today./
* Someone told me that there&  are plenty of fish in the&  sea.../
* Well^1, I'm taking that&  seriously./
* I'm literally going to make&  out with a fish./%%
* I guess I could ask out Undyne^1.&* But I think she likes someone&  already./%%
* Did I catch anyone yet^1?&* I can't bear to look.../%%
* Sans is the most regular&  regular of all./
* He hasn't been showing up&  as much recently though./%%
* Where the heck is Sans?/
* He told me he had some&  bait I could use./
* Though it was probably&  some kind of prank./
* But I wanted to know what&  the prank was!/%%
* In the end^1, I never caught&  any girls on my fishing&  line./
* So kid^1, take it from me.../
* Don't try to catch hot&  people with a fishing rod./
* (Somewhere^1, you hear a whinny&  of dismay.)/%%
